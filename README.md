# Harry-Potter-s-Invisible-Cloak
Built a fun and interactive application that uses color detection and masking to make a cloak appear invisible in 
real time. 
● Background Subtraction: Captured static background and applied color masking to detect cloak region. 
● Invisibility Effect: Replaced the cloak area with the background image to simulate invisibility. 
● Real-Time Processing: Achieved smooth real-time performance using OpenCV.
